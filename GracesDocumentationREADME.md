Modern Melody

Name: Grace Gallagher

Student Number: C23320076

Class Group: Year 1 

Description of the project:
My project is an accumulation of nostalgic sound effects and tunes. I’ve merged these sounds to create strange but cool melodies that can be altered using even cooler switches and sliders.

Instructions for use:
Simply click the pixel art icons to play the sounds assigned to them. Slide the button on the sliders to alter volume/itch as well as the check buttons to equip distortion and echo.

How it works:
I use buttons, hsliders and checkbuttons to play sounds and change effects. I use gd scripting to communicate these changes with the user.

What I am most proud of:
In this assignment, I am most proud of making the check buttons and sliders work and writing/help writing the script for them. Me and Sarah Bullough C23303483 did a lot of collaborative work on this assignment. Together we made these assets work and shared with our peers using the git repo. Using gd script on our own for the first time was a challenge, so I am proud of us for figuring it out. I’m also happy that I got to contribute to big parts of our project.
