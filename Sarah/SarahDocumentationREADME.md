Project Description:
This music project plays a variety of musical and nature sounds. These sounds emulate a feel that you are outside, listening to the sounds around you.

Instructions For Use:
Turn on the switches on the right to play some looping nature sounds. Use the volume slider in the panel to change the volume of just those sounds.
Press the buttons on the left to play short sounds.
Press the red buttons below to play some guitar strums.
Use the sliders at the top to change the master volume and the reverb of all the sounds.
Finally, move the godot icon in the area of its confines to influence the pitch (linked to the y-axis) and some distortion (linked to the x-axis).

How It Works:
The switches/ checkbuttons are linked to sounds through the node menu. Same goes for the all of the buttons.
The volume sliders uses db_to_linear to change the volume of the buses.
The reverb slider attatches the AudioEffectReverb to the master bus and changes its value.
As for the map in the middle of the screen, it uses a draggable sprite and finds the x and y position and uses a multiplier to change the distortion (pre_gain) and pitch (pitch_scale) respectively.

What I Am Most Proud Of:
I am very proud of the map. It took the most time and the most trial and error. I tried a lot of different ways and effects. I tried to use it to change the playback speed/ bpm but I couldnt figure it out. Nonetheless, I am satisfied and proud with the outcome.
I am also proud of simply figuring out godot as an application. It was very tough to learn as I was so used to unity. I worked really closely with Grace Gallagher (C23320076). It was immensely helpful to work with someone else as we figured the program out.
