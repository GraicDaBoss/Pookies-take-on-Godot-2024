Cat Kalimba

In this project I was tasked with creating a soundboard using Godot. I made interactable buttons and sliders that produce sound. In my scene, I used sounds produced entirely by a kalimba

The first button in the scene is a hover button which plays a sound once the cursor hovers over it. The rest of the buttons in my scene play a sound when the cursor is clicked. The slider was added for volume adjustment; however, I was unable to get it to function.

I created cat pixel art for the centre of the screen using Aseprite. The kalimba audios were obtained from freesound.org. The buttons and fonts were made using Godot default Fonts and themes. 

The thing I am most proud of during this assignment was gaining experience in a new game engine. I have exclusively wprked with unity throughout my classes and being exposed to a new engine gave me valuable insight into how to code in a new language and how to implement sound in a scene.
