Description of the project: For my project, I focused on having a consistent aesthetic of realism and colour; alongside fun sounds that match the buttons they're paired with. 

Instructions for use: All that is involved is clicking the lamp icons and letting the sounds play. I reccommend letting each sound play invidiually before combining and see how they blend together. 

I'm quite happy with how my project turned out. I didn't do computer science in secondary school and coming into this course, for both Processing and Godot, I was very unfamiliar with how they worked. I think I learned a lot and applied my learning the best I could whilst using my own strengths, with is drawing and digital art. 

This is the link to my youtube video for a demonstration of each of the sounds: https://youtu.be/79jYV_YOWM8
