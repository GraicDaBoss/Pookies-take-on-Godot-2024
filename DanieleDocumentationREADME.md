Description 

 We were tasked to create an instrument, I chose Space as a theme for my instrument. Each planet has it’s own sound, along with the sun which has a gentle ring. 

Instructions  

Press on the planet that you wish to hear the sound of each planet/sun. There's a slider at the top that changes the volume 


How it works 

Using buttons for the planets and sun I used gd script in godot to instruct them to play sound when pressed, the slider was made to reduce and increase volume

What I am most proud of in the assignment 

The part I’m most proud of is the trial and error of working through my design for the visuals. I learnt that making the background cluttered can completely wash away the design of the overall visual, I believe that the end product is a nice in-between and I am happy how it turned out.
